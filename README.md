# GitHubRxJava:
Interacting with GitHub's API using Retrofit & RxJava

We make use of some of RxJava's core constructs in an Android application.

In this project, we'll use the following resources:
1) Make network calls using [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) & [Retrofit](http://square.github.io/retrofit/) to
2) [GitHub's API](https://developer.github.com/v3/).
